# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn for an e-commerce platform using machine learning. It involves data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
   
   git clone <https://github.com/jharianeetu/Churn-for-an-E-commerce-Platform>
	
2. Install the required dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt	
	
	
Step-by-Step Instructions
	1. Data Analysis
	Run the data_analysis.py script to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
	This script provides insights into the dataset, such as data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.

	python data_analysis.py

    2.Feature Engineering
	Run the feature_engineering.py script to generate user-specific features like recency, frequency, and monetary values.
	The output features are saved in a CSV file (user_features.csv).

	python feature_engineering.py	
	
	3. Model Training
	Run the modeling.py script to train a machine learning model using the engineered features.
	The script saves the trained model as churn_model.pkl.

	python modeling.py
	
	4. Evaluate Results
	Check the logs and outputs generated by the scripts for classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC scores.
	
	5.Dependencies
	The required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. Some key dependencies include:

	pandas
	numpy
	scikit-learn
	flask
	joblib
